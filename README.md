# Vehicle Number Plate Detection

## Project Overview

This project is a starter template for vehicle number plate detection. It provides a foundational Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to set up a data science environment, load and explore a dataset. While this initial version focuses on the exploratory analysis of a vehicle dataset, it is designed to be extended for building a complete Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system.

The included notebook, `vehicle_number_plate_detection.ipynb`, showcases the use of essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It serves as an excellent starting point for anyone interested in computer vision and machine learning applications for vehicle identification.

## Features

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The notebook provides a structured approach to understanding the dataset through various plots and statistical summaries.
*   **Modular Code:** Functions for plotting distributions, correlation matrices, and scatter plots are included to facilitate data exploration.
*   **Extensible Framework:** The project can be easily expanded to include image processing, model training for number plate detection, and optical character recognition (OCR).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You will also need `pip` to install the required packages.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-number-plate-detection.git
    cd vehicle-number-plate-detection
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    This project uses several Python libraries. You can install them using the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    A `requirements.txt` file is included in the repository with the following packages:
    *   `numpy`
    *   `pandas`
    *   `matplotlib`
    *   `scikit-learn`
    *   `jupyter`

## Usage

To run the project and explore the data, you can use the Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Start the Jupyter server:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open the notebook:**
    In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open `vehicle_number_plate_detection.ipynb`.

3.  **Run the cells:**
    You can execute the code cells in the notebook to see the exploratory data analysis in action.

## Built With

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The core programming language used.
*   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - For interactive data analysis.
*   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For data manipulation and analysis.
*   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - For numerical operations.
*   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For data visualization.
*   [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - For data preprocessing.

## Future Work

This project can be extended in several ways:

*   **Image Preprocessing:** Implement techniques to enhance the quality of the images containing number plates.
*   **Object Detection Model:** Train a deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, SSD) to accurately detect the location of number plates in images.
*   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Integrate an OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract, EasyOCR) to extract the text from the detected number plates.
*   **Real-time Detection:** Develop a real-time system using a webcam or video stream for live number plate recognition.
